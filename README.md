## [PROJECT 1: COVID DATA ANALYSIS USING PYTHON (Data Analysis project): Project Overview](https://github.com/Ishitaj14/Covid19-Data-Analysis-using-python)
This project is a basic data analysis of the Covid19 data using python with the aim to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
---

### Introduction
This project was done as a part of the course undertook by me from cousera, I preprocessed and merged datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for Analysis.I worked with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also there is another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.

### Conclusion
It was noticed that there is a positive correlation among the columns related to Happiness of people, living in a country and the column, related to spread of the virus in that country. This brought us to the conclusionn that developed countries are more prone to getting the infection. 


## [PROJECT 2: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF RESTAURANT REVIEWS (NLP Based ML Classification Project): Project Overview](https://github.com/Ishitaj14/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews)
This is a Data Science Project based on using Natural Language processing with Restaurant reviews and analyzing the text data to finally perform sentiment analysis using Text classification

### Introduction
The aim of this analysis is to build a prediction model to predict whether a review on the restaurant is positive or negative. To do so, I worked on Restaurant Review dataset , and loaded it into predicitve algorithms Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Towards the end I tried to find the "best" model for predicting the review's sentiment.

### Conclusion
The sentiment analyis was carried out through various methods. It was observed that Multinomial Naive Bayes is slightly better method compared to Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, with 77.67% accuracy which means the model built for the prediction of sentiment of the restaurant review gives 77.67% right prediction.
The aim of the model is to correctly detect the sentiments of the textual reviews or feedback. The developed model can successfully detects the sentiments of the textual reviews or feedback. The model has been tested with few of the online reviews and was found that it detects the sentiments correctly. Thus, we can conclude that the motive was successful and this model can be used by restarants to understand their sentiments through their reviews and accordingly they can work on their shortcomings.
